# QPSK-Wireless-Link-Simulator

A modular Python project that simulates a baseband **QPSK digital communication system** including:

* Bit generation
* QPSK modulation (Gray-coded)
* Root Raised Cosine (RRC) pulse shaping
* AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels
* Matched filtering + symbol timing
* Hard-decision demodulation
* BER performance evaluation
* Constellation visualization

This repository is built to be **clean, modular, extendable**, and easy to integrate with additional wireless communication blocks.

## 🧠 Theory Summary

### QPSK Symbol Mapping (Gray Code)

Two bits map to one complex symbol:

| Bits | Symbol                      |
| ---- | --------------------------- |
| 00   | ( \frac{1 + j}{\sqrt{2}} )  |
| 01   | ( \frac{-1 + j}{\sqrt{2}} ) |
| 11   | ( \frac{-1 - j}{\sqrt{2}} ) |
| 10   | ( \frac{1 - j}{\sqrt{2}} )  |

---

### Root Raised Cosine Filter

The RRC filter is used for:

* Bandwidth control
* Inter-symbol interference reduction
* Optimal matched filtering

Filter parameters:

* Roll-off factor ( \beta = 0.35 )
* Samples per symbol (SPS) = 8
* Tap count = ( 8 \times \text{SPS} + 1 )

---

### Channel Models

#### 1. Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN)

Noise added based on target SNR:
[
\text{SNR} = 10 \log_{10} \left( \frac{P_s}{P_n} \right)
]

#### 2. Rayleigh Fading

Flat-fading coefficient:
[
h = \frac{X + jY}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad X, Y \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)
]

## 🛠 Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/obiedeh/QPSK-Wireless-Link-Simulator.git
cd QPSK-Wireless-Link-Simulator
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Running the Simulator

### Run the BER simulation + plots

```
python main.py
```

This will:

* Generate BER vs SNR curves (AWGN & Rayleigh)
* Plot constellations
* Print performance summary

---

## 📊 Example Outputs

### BER Curve

* AWGN curve drops ~10⁻³ at 10 dB
* Rayleigh curve is much worse (fading penalty)

### Constellation

* Perfect 4-point square at high SNR
* Scatter expands at low SNR

## 🧩 Extending the Project

Here are suggested enhancements:

### 🔧 PHY Layer Enhancements

* Carrier frequency offset (CFO)
